    "1": "My first 3D website and my first low poly style scene. I first fully modeled the scene in Blender, optimizing the polygons as much as possible. Then, I integrated the model with Three.js and created some animations with GSAP. This project allowed me to confirm my learning of 5 chapters from the Three.js Journey course and to explore a new style in Blender.",

    "3": "This project allowed me to apply numerous integration concepts. I also developed a brand identity, created the logo, harmonized the interfaces to establish visual coherence, and emphasized the user experience. I deeply reflected on the goal and target audience of this project. The answers I obtained guided my design choices.",
    "4": "The Fluff Event is a charity marathon on Twitch. I had the opportunity to work with many volunteers to successfully complete the 2024 edition. I designed and integrated several web pages, including the one presenting the 2024 edition (in 5 hours!). I also created mockups and visuals for the merchandise. This project was very enriching and I hope to help again in 2025!",
    "5": "In this project, I applied many design concepts acquired through my previous work. The core of this project is the creation of a dynamic, accessible, and coherent site. I led most of the art direction, particularly in choosing this soft and warm color palette, which helped affirm the nature of the fictional association Bibble's."
